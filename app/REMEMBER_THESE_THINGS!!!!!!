changed
'protect_from_forgery with: :exception' to application_controller.rb
to
'protect_from_forgery with: :null_session' for testing purposes.
Needs to be changed back for security reasons.

After create and after update, am now redirecting to edit_project path rather than to project

Receive_service_output is not static, want to find a way to make it
static as not to depend on the initial 'create' connection
